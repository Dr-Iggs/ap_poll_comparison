# AP Poll Team Comparison

In honor of BYU passing Alabama in the most recent AP Poll, I built a tool that lets you compare rankings across teams.
Enter in any 2 teams and see the most recent time one was higher than the other in the polls.

In the future, it'll be a lot prettier and take into account whether a team was in the poll while the other was unranked.

Thanks to (sports-reference.com)[sports_reference.com] for the AP poll history.
